/*
    A linear-gradient may have two or more colors. The first param is the direction. It can be passed
    in deg or coordinates, like 'to right bottom'. The other params are the colors. Each color has a start
    and end point. If not specified, these will be centered by default, and the colors will blend. These
    points can be passed as percentages, specifying where the color will start or end. If the end point of
    a color is exactly the same as the start point of the next color, they will not blend, as in the book
    example above. If there is some space between the end point of a color and the start of the next, the
    colors will blend in this space. If these points are not specified, the colors blend.
